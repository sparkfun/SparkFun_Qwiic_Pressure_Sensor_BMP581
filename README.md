The SparkFun Pressure Sensor - BMP581 (Qwiic) and Micro Pressure Sensor - BMP581 (Qwiic) features the BMP581 pressure sensor from Bosch Sensortec. The BMP581 boasts exceptional resolution (down to 1/64 Pa) and accuracy  and uses on-chip linearization and temperature compensation to provide true absolute data for pressure and temperature. 

The BMP581 has a wide pressure sensing range (30 to 125 kPa) with excellent accuracy across the sensing range (&plusmn; 0.5 hPa (max)) as well as output data rates up to 622 Hz. The sensor includes a configurable oversampling setting, FIFO buffer for storing up to 32 pressure samples, programmable low-pass filtering and even 6-bytes of user-programmable non-volatile memory. All of this allows you to customize the performance based on your application's requirements. Even without filtering, the BMP581 has very low noise (< 0.1Pa RMS).
